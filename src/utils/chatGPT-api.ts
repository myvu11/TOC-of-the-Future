          '\nChapter:\n<p>\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and\nof having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister\nwas reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is\nthe use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or\nconversations?”\n</p>\n<p>\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day\nmade her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a\ndaisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,\nwhen suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was nothing so <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\n<i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it\noccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all\nseemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of its\nwaistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a\nrabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and\nburning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was\njust in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the\nworld she was to get out again.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped\nsuddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping\nherself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n</p>\n<p>\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of\ntime as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen\nnext. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it\nwas too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there\nshe saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the\nshelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to\nher great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for\nfear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this,\nI shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all\nthink me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell\noff the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\n</p>\n<p>\nDown, down, down. Would the fall <i>never</i> come to an end? “I wonder\nhow many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I\nmust be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had\nlearnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though\nthis was not a <i>very</i> good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as\nthere was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)\n“—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I\nwonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea\nwhat Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words\nto say.)\n</p>\n<p>\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right <i>through</i>\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was\nrather glad there <i>was</i> no one listening, this time, as it didn’t\nsound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what\nthe name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand\nor Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy\n<i>curtseying</i> as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you\ncould manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me\nfor asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up\nsomewhere.”\n</p>\n<p>\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking\nagain. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice\nin the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very\nlike a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice\nbegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\nway, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do\nbats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either\nquestion, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she\nwas dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand\nwith Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the\ntruth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she\ncame upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she\nlooked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,\nand the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a\nmoment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear\nit say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\nit’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner,\nbut the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall,\nwhich was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice\nhad been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she\nwalked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n</p>\n<p>\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;\nthere was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first\nthought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!\neither the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it\nwould not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a\nlow curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about\nfifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her\ngreat delight it fitted!\n</p>\n<p>\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much\nlarger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the\nloveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and\nwander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\nshe could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head\nwould go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little\nuse without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I\nthink I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many\nout-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that\nvery few things indeed were really impossible.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to\nthe table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book\nof rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little\nbottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,)\nand round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK\nME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice\nwas not going to do <i>that</i> in a hurry. “No, I’ll look\nfirst,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked\n‘<i>poison</i>’ or not”; for she had read several nice little\nhistories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and\nother unpleasant things, all because they <i>would</i> not remember the simple\nrules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn\nyou if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger <i>very</i> deeply\nwith a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink\nmuch from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to\ndisagree with you, sooner or later.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, this bottle was <i>not</i> marked “poison,” so Alice\nventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of\nmixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n</p>\n<p class="asterism">\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n    *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n<br/>\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up\nlike a telescope.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened\nup at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little\ndoor into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to\nsee if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about\nthis; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself,\n“in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be\nlike then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like\nafter the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such\na thing.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into\nthe garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she\nfound she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the\ntable for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite\nplainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs\nof the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with\ntrying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n</p>\n<p>\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to\nherself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!”\nShe generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed\nit), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her\neyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated\nherself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\nchild was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no\nuse now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why,\nthere’s hardly enough of me left to make <i>one</i> respectable\nperson!”\n</p>\n<p>\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she\nopened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT\nME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat\nit,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the\nkey; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way\nI’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\n</p>\n<p>\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size:\nto be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so\nmuch into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,\nthat it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n</p>',
