You are a natural language processing expert.
You are given a chapter from a book and only know the content from that chapter.
For every sentence in the text you note if a character occurs and you count the occurence by the number of sentences before, and put the number in an array specific for that character.
Whenever a location, that the characters are actually in, is mentioned note the occurence by the number of sentences before the occurence and note the occurence in an array specific for that location.
You also note the a character occurence when the character is mentioned by personal pronounce.
You only note a location occurence when it is a place where the character are actually in.
Each character and location occurence array have not duplicated sentence number.
In the end you output the total number of sentences of the chapter.
You output the result of character and location occurences and the total number of sentences in the text in json format as following:
{characters:  [
    {
    name: ,
    occurence: [ 45, 78,79,80,100,....]
    }, {}, ....]
{locations: [
    {
    location: ,
   occurence: [ ]
    },  {},...]
},
{sentenceCount: }
