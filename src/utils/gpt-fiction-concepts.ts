      "content": "<p>Scattered over the earth at the present time various stages of\ncivilization are to be found, from the primitive savages to the most\nhighly cultivated peoples. Although it is possible that there are tribes\nof lowly beings on earth to-day unfamiliar with fire or ignorant of its\nuses, savages are generally able to make fire. Thus the use of fire may\nserve the purpose of distinguishing human beings from the lower animals.\nSurely the savage of to-day who is unable to kindle fire or who\npossesses a mind as yet insufficiently developed to realize its\npossibilities, is quite at the mercy of nature's whims. He lives merely\nby animal prowess and differs little in deeds and needs from the beasts\nof the jungle. In this imaginary journey to the remote regions beyond\nthe outskirts of civilization it soon becomes evident that the\ndevelopment of artificial light may be a fair measure of civilization.</p>\n<p>In viewing the development of artificial light it is seen that preceding\nthe modern electrical age, man depended universally upon burning\nmaterial. Obviously, the course of civilization has been highly complex\nand cannot be symbolized adequately by the branching tree. From its\nobscure beginning far in the impenetrable fog of prehistoric times, it\nhas branched here and there. These various branches have been subjected\nto many different influences, with the result that <a class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"Page_16\"></a>some flourished and\nendured, some retrogressed, some died, some went to seed and fell to\ntake root and to begin again the upward climb. The ultimate result is\nthe varied civilization of the present time, a study of which aids in\npenetrating the veil that obscures the ages of unrecorded writing.\nLikewise, material relics of bygone ages supply some threads of the\nstory of human progress and mythology aids in spanning the misty gap\nbetween the earliest ages of man and the period when historic writings\nwere begun. Throughout these various stages it becomes manifest that the\ndevelopment of artificial light is associated with the progress of\nmankind.</p>\n<div class=\"floatl\">\n<a id=\"image2\"/>\n<img alt=\"PRIMITIVE FIRE-BASKETS\" src=\"5243263665689775744_image2.png\" title=\"PRIMITIVE FIRE-BASKETS\" id=\"id-3358348856998553355\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">PRIMITIVE FIRE-BASKETS</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"floatr\">\n<a id=\"image3\"/>\n<img alt=\"CRUDE SPLINTER-HOLDERS\" src=\"5243263665689775744_image3.png\" title=\"CRUDE SPLINTER-HOLDERS\" id=\"id-6216583205960126827\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">CRUDE SPLINTER-HOLDERS</p>\n</div>\n<p>According to a certain myth, Prometheus stole fire from heaven and\nbrought this blessing to earth. Throughout the mythologies of various\nraces, fire and, as a consequence, light have been associated with\ndivinity. They have been subjects of worship perhaps more generally than\nanything else, and these early impressions have survived in the\nceremonial uses of light and fire even to the present time. The origin\nof fire as represented in any of the myths of the superstitious beings\nof early ages is as suitable as any other, inasmuch as definite\nknowledge is unavailable. Active volcanoes, spontaneous combustion,\nfriction, accidental focusing of the sun's image, and other means may\nhave introduced primitive beings to fire. A study of savage tribes of\nthe present age combined with a survey of past history of mythology, of\nmaterial relics, and of the absence of lamps or other lighting utensils\nleads to the conclusion that the earliest source of light was the wood\nfire.</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<a id=\"image4\"/>\n<img alt=\"EARLY OPEN-FLAME OIL AND GREASE LAMPS\" class=\"framed\" src=\"5243263665689775744_image4.png\" title=\"EARLY OPEN-FLAME OIL AND GREASE LAMPS\" id=\"id-7347255351678527239\"/>\n<p class=\"caption\">EARLY OPEN-FLAME OIL AND GREASE LAMPS</p>\n</div>\n<p><a class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"Page_17\"></a>Even to-day the savages of remote lands have not advanced further than\nthe wood-fire stage, and they may be found kneeling upon the ground\nenergetically but skilfully rubbing sticks together until the friction\nkindles a fire. In using these fire-sticks they convert mechanical\nenergy into heat energy. This is a fundamental principle of physics,\nemployed by them as necessity demands, but they are totally ignorant of\nit as a scientific law. The things which these savages learn are the\nresult of accidental discovery. Until man pondered over such simple\nfacts and coördinated them so that he could extend his knowledge by\ngeneral reasoning, his progress could not be rapid. But the sluggish\nmind of primitive man is capable of devising improvements, however\nslowly, and the art of making fire by means of rubbing fire-sticks\ngradually became more refined. Mechanical improvements resulted from\nexperience, with the consequence that finally one stick was rubbed to\nand fro in a groove, or was rapidly twirled between the palms of the\nhands while one end was pressed firmly into a hole in a piece of wood.\nIn the course of a few seconds or a minute, depending upon skill and\nother conditions, a fire was obtained. It is interesting to note how\ncivilized man is often compelled by necessity to adopt the methods of\nprimitive beings. The rubbing of sticks is an emergency measure of the\nmaster of woodcraft at the present time, and the production of fire in\nthis manner is the proud accomplishment or ambition of every Boy Scout.</p>\n<p>Where only such crude means of kindling fire were available it became\nthe custom in some cases to maintain a fire burning continuously in a\npublic place.<a class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"Page_18\"></a> Around this pyrtaneum the various civil, political, and\nreligious affairs were carried on by the light and warmth of the public\nfire. Many quaint customs evolved, apparently, from this ancient\nprocedure.</p>\n<p>The tinder-box of modern centuries doubtless originated in very early\ntimes, for it is inconceivable that the earliest beings did not become\naware of the production of sparks when certain stones were struck\ntogether. In the stone age, when human beings spent much of their time\nchiseling implements and utensils from stone by means of tools of the\nsame substance, it appears certain that this means of producing fire was\never apparent. Many of their sharp implements, such as knives and\narrow-heads, were made of quartz and <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"Transcriber's Note: Original reads &quot;similiar&quot;\">similar</ins> material and it is likely that the use of two\npieces of quartz for producing a spark originated in those remote\nperiods. Alaskan and Aleutian tribes are known to have employed two\npieces of quartz covered with native sulphur. When these were struck\ntogether with skill, excellent sparks were obtained.</p>\n<p>Later, when iron and steel became available, the more modern tinder-box\nwas developed. An early application of the flint-and-steel principle was\nmade by certain Esquimo tribes who obtained fire by striking a piece of\nquartz against a piece of iron pyrites. The latter is a yellow sulphide\nof iron, of crystalline form, best known as \"fool's gold.\" Doubtless,\nthe more primitive beings used dried grass, leaves, and moss as\ninflammable material upon which the sparks were showered. In later\ncenturies the tinder-box was filled with charred grass, linen, and\npaper. There was a long interval between the development of fire-sticks\n<a class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"Page_19\"></a>and that of the tinder-box as measured by the progress of civilization.\nDuring recent centuries ordinary brown paper soaked in saltpeter and\ndried was utilized satisfactorily as an inflammable material. Such\ndevices have been employed in past ages in widely separated regions of\nthe earth. Elaborate specimens of tinder-boxes from Jamaica, Japan,\nChina, Europe, and various other countries are now reposing in the\ncollections in the possession of museums and of individuals.</p>\n<p>If the radiant energy from the sun is sufficiently concentrated upon\ninflammable material, the latter will ignite. Such concentration may be\nachieved by means of a convex lens or a concave mirror. This method of\nproducing fire does not antedate the more primitive methods such as\nstriking quartz or rubbing wooden sticks, because the materials required\nare not readily found or prepared, but it is of very remote origin.\nAristophanes in his comedy \"The Clouds,\" which is a satire aimed at the\nscience and philosophy of his period (488-385 <abbr>B. C.</abbr>), mentions\nthe \"burning lens.\" Nearly every one is familiar with an achievement\nattributed to Archimedes in which he destroyed the ships at Syracuse by\nfocusing the image of the sun upon them by means of a concave mirror.\nThe ancient Egyptians were proficient in the art of glass-making, so it\nis likely that the \"burning-glass\" was employed by them. Even a crude\nlens of glass will focus an image of the sun sufficiently well to cause\ninflammable material to ignite.</p>\n<p>The energy in sunlight varies enormously, even on clear days, because\nthe water-vapor in the atmosphere <a class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"Page_20\"></a>absorbs some of the radiant energy\nemitted by the sun. This absorbed radiation is chiefly known as\ninfra-red energy, which does not arouse the sensation of light. When the\nwater-vapor content of the atmosphere is high, the sun, though it may\nappear as bright to the eye, in reality is not as hot as it would be if\nthe water-vapor were not present. However, a fire may be kindled by\nconcentrating only the visible rays in sunlight because of the enormous\nintensity of sunlight. A convex lens fashioned from ice by means of a\nsharp-edged stone and finally shaped by melting the surfaces as they are\nrubbed in the palms of the hands, will kindle a fire in highly\ninflammable material if the sun is high and the atmosphere is fairly\nclear. Burning-glasses are used to a considerable extent at the present\ntime in certain countries and it is reported that British soldiers were\nsupplied with them during the Boer War. Indicative of the predominant\nuse to which the glass lens was applied in the past is the employment of\nthe term \"burning-glass\" instead of lens in the scientific writings as\nlate as a century or two ago.</p>\n<p>As civilization advanced, leading intellects began to inquire into the\nmysteries of nature and the periods of pure philosophy gave way to an\nera of methodical research. Alchemy and superstition began to retire\nbefore the attacks of those pioneers who had the temerity to believe\nthat the scheme of creation involved a vast network of invariable laws.\nIn this manner the powerful sciences of physics and chemistry were born\na few centuries ago. Among other things the production of fire and light\nreceived attention and the \"dark ages\" were doomed to end. The crude,\nuncertain, and <a class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"Page_21\"></a>inconvenient methods of making fire were replaced by\nsteadily improving scientific devices.</p>\n<p>Matches were at first cumbersome, dangerous, and expensive, but these\ngradually evolved into the safety matches of the present time. Although\nthey were primarily intended for lighting fires and various kinds of\nlamps, billions of them are now used yearly as convenient light-sources.\nSmoldering hemp or other material treated with niter and other\nsubstances was an early form of match used especially for discharging\nfirearms. The modern wax-taper is an evolutionary form of this type of\nlight-source.</p>\n<p>Phosphorus has long played a dominant rôle in the preparation of\nmatches. The first attempt at making them in their modern form appears\nto have occurred about 1680. Small pieces of phosphorus were used in\nconnection with small splints of wood dipped in sulphur. This type of\nmatch did not come into general use until after the beginning of the\nnineteenth century, owing to its danger and expense. White or yellow\nphosphorus is a deadly poison; therefore the progress of the phosphorus\nmatch was inhibited until the discovery of the relatively harmless form\nknown as red phosphorus. The first commercial application of this form\nwas made in about 1850.</p>\n<p>An early ingenious device consisted of a piece of phosphorus contained\nin a tube. A piston fitted snugly into the tube, by means of which the\nair could be compressed and the phosphorus ignited. Sulphur matches were\nignited from the burning tinder, the latter being fired by flint and\nsteel. In 1828 another form of match consisted of a glass tube\ncontaining sulphuric <a class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"Page_22\"></a>acid and surrounded by a mixture of chlorate of\npotash and sugar. A pair of nippers was supplied with each box of these\n\"matches,\" by means of which the tip of the glass tube could be broken\noff. This liberated the acid, which upon mixing with the other\ningredients set fire to them. To this contrivance a roll of paper was\nattached which was ignited by the burning chemicals.</p>\n<p>The lucifer or friction matches appeared in about 1827, but successful\nphosphorus matches were first made in about 1833. The so-called safety\nmatch of the present time was invented in the year 1855. To-day, the\ntotal daily output of matches reaches millions and perhaps billions.\nAutomatic machinery is employed in preparing the splints of wood and in\ndipping them into molten paraffin wax and finally into the igniting\ncomposition.</p>\n<p>During recent years the principle of the tinder-box has been revived in\na device in which sparks are produced by rubbing the mineral cerite (a\nhydrous silicate of cerium and allied metals) against steel. These\nsparks ignite a gas-jet or a wick soaked in a highly inflammable liquid\nsuch as gasolene or alcohol. This device is a tinder-box of the modern\nscientific age.</p>\n<p>Naturally with the advent of electricity, electrical sparks came into\nuse for lighting gas-jets and mantles and in isolated instances they\nhave served as light-sources. Doubtless, every one is familiar with the\nparlor stunt of igniting a gas-jet from the discharge from the\nfinger-tips of static electricity accumulated by shuffling the feet\nacross the floor-rug.</p>\n<p>Although many of these methods and devices have <a class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"Page_23\"></a>been used primarily for\nmaking fire, they have served as emergency or momentary light-sources.\nIn the outskirts of civilization some of them are employed at the\npresent time and various modern light-sources require a method of\nignition.</p>"
