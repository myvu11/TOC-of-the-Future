deep and green.","The water is warm too, for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool.","On one side of the river the golden foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan mountains, but on the valley side the water is lined with trees—willows fresh and green with every spring, carrying in their lower leaf junctures the debris of the winter’s flooding; and sycamores with mottled, white, recumbent limbs and branches that arch over the pool.","On the sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skittering if he runs among them.","Rabbits come out of the brush to sit on the sand in the evening, and the damp flats are covered with the night tracks of ’coons, and with the spread pads of dogs from the ranches, and with the split–wedge tracks of deer that come to drink in the dark.","There is a path through the willows and among the sycamores, a path beaten hard by boys coming down from the ranches to swim in the deep pool, and beaten hard by tramps who come wearily down from the highway in the evening to jungle–up near water.","In front of the low horizontal limb of a giant sycamore there is an ash pile made by many fires; the limb is worn smooth by men who have sat on it.\r\n * * * * *\r\n Evening of a hot day started the little wind to moving among the leaves.","The shade climbed up the hills toward the top.","On the sand banks the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray, sculptured stones.","And then from the direction of the state highway came the sound of footsteps on crisp sycamore leaves.","The rabbits hurried noiselessly for cover.","A stilted heron labored up into the air and pounded down river.","For a moment the place was lifeless, and then two men emerged from the path and came into the opening by the green pool.","They had walked in single file down the path, and even in the open one stayed behind the other.","Both were dressed in denim trousers and in denim coats with brass buttons.","Both wore black, shapeless hats and both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders.","The first man was small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp, strong features.","Every part of him was defined: small, strong hands, slender arms, a thin and bony nose.","Behind him walked his opposite, a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, with wide, sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws.","His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung loosely.","The first man stopped short in the clearing, and the follower nearly ran over him.","He took off his hat and wiped the sweat–band with his forefinger and snapped the moisture off.","His huge companion dropped his blankets and flung himself down and drank from the surface of the green pool; drank with long gulps, snorting into the water like a horse.","The small man stepped nervously beside him.\r\n “Lennie!” he said sharply. “Lennie, for God’ sakes don’t drink so much.” Lennie continued to snort into the pool.","The small man leaned over and shook him by the shoulder. “Lennie.","You gonna be sick like you was last night.”\r\n Lennie dipped his whole head under, hat and all, and then he sat up on the bank and his hat dripped down on his blue coat and ran down his back. “Tha’s good,” he said. “You drink some, George.","You take a good big drink.” He smiled happily.","George unslung his bindle and dropped it gently on the bank. “I ain’t sure it’s good water,” he said. “Looks kinda scummy.”\r\n Lennie dabbled his big paw in the water and wiggled his fingers so the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool to the other side and came back again.","Lennie watched them go. “Look, George.","Look what I done.”\r\n George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick scoops. “Tastes all right,” he admitted. “Don’t really seem to be running, though.","You never oughta drink water when it ain’t running, Lennie,” he said hopelessly. “You’d drink out of a gutter if you was thirsty.” He threw a scoop of water into his face and rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin and around the back of his neck.","Then he replaced his hat, pushed himself back from the river, drew up his knees and embraced them.","Lennie, who had been watching, imitated George exactly.","He pushed himself back, drew up his knees, embraced them, looked over to George to see whether he had it just right.","He pulled his hat down a little more over his eyes, the way George’s hat was.","George stared morosely at the water.","The rims of his eyes were red with sun glare.","He said angrily, “We could just as well of rode clear to the ranch if that bastard bus driver knew what he was talkin’ about. ‘Jes’ a little stretch down the highway,’ he says. ‘Jes’ a little stretch.’ God damn near four miles, that’s what it was!","Didn’t wanta stop at the ranch gate, that’s what.","Too God damn lazy to pull up.","Wonder he isn’t too damn good to stop in Soledad at all.","Kicks us out and says, ‘Jes’ a little stretch down the road.’ I bet it wasmore than four miles.","Damn hot day.”\r\n Lennie looked timidly over to him. “George?”\r\n “Yeah, what ya want?”\r\n “Where we goin’, George?”\r\n The little man jerked down the brim of his hat and scowled over at Lennie. “So you forgot that awready, did you?","I gotta tell you again, do I?","Jesus Christ, you’re a crazy bastard!”\r\n “I forgot,” Lennie said softly. “I tried not to forget.","Honest to God I did, George.”\r\n “O."]},{"sectionID":2,"sectionTitle":"Introduction of Characters","text":["K.—O.","K.","I’ll tell ya again.","I ain’t got nothing to do.","Might jus’ as well spen’ all my time tellin’ you things and then you forget ’em, and I tell you again.” “Tried and tried,” said Lennie, “but it didn’t do no good.","I remember about the rabbits, George.”\r\n “The hell with the rabbits.","That’s all you ever can remember is them rabbits.","O.","K.!","Now you listen and this time you got to remember so we don’t get in no trouble.","You remember settin’ in that gutter on Howard street and watchin’ that blackboard?”\r\n Lennie’s face broke into a delighted smile. “Why sure, George, I remember that … but … what’d we do then?","I remember some girls come by and you says … you say … ”\r\n “The hell with what I says.","You remember about us goin’ into Murray and Ready’s, and they give us work cards and bus tickets?”\r\n “Oh, sure, George.","I remember that now.” His hands went quickly into his side coat pockets.","He said gently, “George … I ain’t got mine.","I musta lost it.” He looked down at the ground in despair.\r\n “You never had none, you crazy bastard.","I got both of ’em here.","Think I’d let you carry your own work card?”\r\n Lennie grinned with relief. “I … I thought I put it in my side pocket.” His hand went into the pocket again.","George looked sharply at him. “What’d you take outa that pocket?”\r\n “Ain’t a thing in my pocket,” Lennie said cleverly.\r\n “I know there ain’t.","You got it in your hand.","What you got in your hand—hidin’ it?”\r\n “I ain’t got nothin’, George.","Honest.”\r\n “Come on, give it here.”\r\n Lennie held his closed hand away from George’s direction. “It’s on’y a mouse, George.”\r\n “A mouse?","A live mouse?”\r\n “Uh–uh.","Jus’ a dead mouse, George.","I didn’ kill it.","Honest!","I found it.","I found it dead.”\r\n “Give it here!” said George.\r\n “Aw, leave me have it, George.”\r\n “Give it here!”\r\n Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed.","George took the mouse and threw it across the pool to the other side, among the brush. “What you want of a dead mouse, anyways?”\r\n “I could pet it with my thumb while we walked along,” said Lennie.\r\n “Well, you ain’t petting no mice while you walk with me.","You remember where we’re goin’ now?”\r\n Lennie looked startled and then in embarrassment hid his face against his knees. “I forgot again.”\r\n “Jesus Christ,” George said resignedly. “Well—look, we’re gonna work on a ranch like the one we come from up north.”\r\n “Up north?”\r\n “In Weed.”\r\n “Oh, sure.","I remember.","In Weed.”\r\n “That ranch we’re goin’ to is right down there about a quarter mile.","We’re gonna go in an’ see the boss.","Now, look—I’ll give him the work tickets, but you ain’t gonna say a word.","You jus’ stand there and don’t say nothing.","If he finds out what a crazy bastard you are, we won’t get no job, but if he sees ya work before he hears ya talk, we’re set.","Ya got that?”\r\n “Sure, George.","Sure I got it.”\r\n “O.","K.","Now when we go in to see the boss, what you gonna do?”\r\n “I … I,” Lennie thought.","His face grew tight with thought. “I … ain’t gonna say nothin’.","Jus’ gonna stan’ there.”\r\n “Good boy.","That’s swell.","You say that over two, three times so you sure won’t forget it.”\r\n Lennie droned to himself softly, “I ain’t gonna say nothin’ … I ain’t gonna say nothin’ … I ain’t gonna say nothin’.”\r\n “O.","K.,” said George. “An’ you ain’t gonna do no bad things like you done in Weed, neither.”\r\n Lennie looked puzzled. “Like I done in Weed?”\r\n “Oh, so ya forgot that too, did ya?","Well, I ain’t gonna remind ya, fear ya do it again.”\r\n A light of understanding broke on Lennie’s face. “They run us outa Weed,” he exploded triumphantly.\r\n “Run us out, hell,” said George disgustedly. “We run."]},{"sectionID":3,"sectionTitle":"George and Lennie's Relationship","text":["They was lookin’ for us, but they didn’t catch us.”\r\n Lennie giggled happily. “I didn’t forget that, you bet.”\r\n George lay back on the sand and crossed his hands under his head, and Lennie imitated him, raising his head to see whether he were doing it right. “God, you’re a lot of trouble,” said George. “I could get along so easy and so nice if I didn’t have you on my tail.","I could live so easy and maybe have a girl.”\r\n For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he said hopefully, “We gonna work on a ranch, George.”\r\n “Awright.","You got that.","But we’re gonna sleep here because I got a reason.”\r\n The day was going fast now.","Only the tops of the Gabilan mountains flamed with the light of the sun that had gone from the valley.","A water snake slipped along on the pool, its head held up like a little periscope.","The reeds jerked slightly in the current.","Far off toward the highway a man shouted something, and another man shouted back.","The sycamore limbs rustled under a little wind that died immediately.\r\n “George—why ain’t we goin’ on to the ranch and get some supper?","They got supper at the ranch.”\r\n George rolled on his side. “No reason at all for you.","I like it here.","Tomorra we’re gonna go to work.","I seen thrashin’ machines on the way down.","That means we’ll be bucking grain bags, bustin’ a gut.","Tonight I’m gonna lay right here and look up.","I like it.”\r\n Lennie got up on his knees and looked down at George. “Ain’t we gonna have no supper?”\r\n “Sure we are, if you gather up some dead willow sticks.","I got three can of beans in my bindle.","You get a fire ready.","I’ll give you a match when you get the sticks together.","Then we’ll heat the beans and have supper.”\r\n Lennie said, “I like beans with ketchup.”\r\n “Well, we ain’t got no ketchup.","You go get wood.","An’ don’t you fool around.","It’ll be dark before long.”\r\n Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared in the brush.","George lay where he was and whistled softly to himself.","There were sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had taken.","George stopped whistling and listened. “Poor bastard,” he said softly, and then went on whistling again.","In a moment Lennie came crashing back through the brush.","He carried one small willow stick in his hand.","George sat up. “Awright,” he said brusquely. “Gi’me that mouse!”\r\n But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence. “What mouse, George?","I ain’t got no mouse.”\r\n George held out his hand. “Come on.","Give it to me.","You ain’t puttin’ nothing over.”\r\n Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as though he contemplated running for his freedom.","George said coldly, “You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?”\r\n “Give you what, George?”\r\n “You know God damn well what.","I want that mouse.”\r\n Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket.","His voice broke a little. “I don’t know why I can’t keep it.","It ain’t nobody’s mouse.","I didn’t steal it.","I found it lyin’ right beside the road.”\r\n George’s hand remained outstretched imperiously.","Slowly, like a terrier who doesn’t want to bring a ball to its master, Lennie approached, drew back, approached again.","George snapped his fingers sharply, and at the sound Lennie laid the mouse in his hand.\r\n “I wasn’t doin’ nothing bad with it, George.","Jus’ strokin’ it.”\r\n George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the darkening brush, and then he stepped to the pool and washed his hands. “You crazy fool.","Don’t you think I could see your feet was wet where you went acrost the river to get it?” He heard Lennie’s whimpering cry and wheeled about. “Blubberin’ like a baby!","Jesus Christ!","A big guy like you.” Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started in his eyes. “Aw, Lennie!” George put his hand on Lennie’s shoulder. “I ain’t takin’ it away jus’ for meanness.","That mouse ain’t fresh, Lennie; and besides, you’ve broke it pettin’ it.","You get another mouse that’s fresh and I’ll let you keep it a little while.”\r\n Lennie sat down on the ground and hung his head dejectedly. “I don’t know where there is no other mouse."]},{"sectionID":4,"sectionTitle":"Dreams and Aspirations","text":["I remember a lady used to give ’em to me—ever’ one she got.","But that lady ain’t here.”\r\n George scoffed. “Lady, huh?","Don’t even remember who that lady was.","That was your own Aunt Clara.","An’ she stopped givin’ ’em to ya.","You always killed em.”\r\n Lennie looked sadly up at him. “They was so little,” he said, apologetically. “I’d pet ’em, and pretty soon they bit my fingers and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead—because they was so little.”\r\n “I wish’t we’d get the rabbits pretty soon, George.","They ain’t so little.”\r\n “The hell with the rabbits.","An’ you ain’t to be trusted with no live mice.","Your Aunt Clara give you a rubber mouse and you wouldn’t have nothing to do with it.”\r\n “It wasn’t no good to pet,” said Lennie.","The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountain–tops and dusk came into the valley, and a half darkness came in among the willows and the sycamores.","A big carp rose to the surface of the pool, gulped air and then sank mysteriously into the dark water again, leaving widening rings on the water.","Overhead the leaves whisked again and little puffs of willow cotton blew down and landed on the pool’s surface.\r\n “You gonna get that wood?” George demanded. “There’s plenty right up against the back of that sycamore.","Floodwater wood.","Now you get it.”\r\n Lennie went behind the tree and brought out a litter of dried leaves and twigs.","He threw them in a heap on the old ash pile and went back for more and more.","It was almost night now.","A dove’s wings whistled over the water.","George walked to the fire pile and lighted the dry leaves.","The flame cracked up among the twigs and fell to work.","George undid his bindle and brought out three cans of beans.","He stood them about the fire, close in against the blaze, but not quite touching the flame.\r\n “There’s enough beans for four men,” George said.","Lennie watched him from over the fire.","He said patiently, “I like ’em with ketchup.”\r\n “Well, we ain’t got any,” George exploded. “Whatever we ain’t got, that’s what you want.","God a’mighty, if I was alone I could live so easy.","I could go get a job an’ work, an’ no trouble.","No mess at all, and when the end of the month come I could take my fifty bucks and go into town and get whatever I

gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room and play cards or shoot pool.” Lennie knelt and looked over the fire at the angry George.","And Lennie’s face was drawn with terror. “An’ whatta I got,” George

do bad things and I got to get you out.” His voice rose nearly to a shout. “You crazy son–of–a–bitch.","You keep me in hot water all the time.” He took on the elaborate manner of little girls when

anguished face, and then he looked ashamedly at the flames.","It was quite dark now, but the fire lighted the trunks of the trees and the curving branches overhead.","Lennie crawled slowly and cautiously around the fire until he was close to George.","He sat back on his heels.","George turned the bean cans so that another side faced the fire."]},{"sectionID":5,"sectionTitle":"Conflict and

long, rectangular building.","Inside, the walls were whitewashed and the floor unpainted.","In three walls there were small, square windows, and in the fourth, a solid door with a wooden latch.","Against the walls were eight bunks, five of them made up with blankets and the other three showing their burlap ticking.","Over each bunk there was nailed an apple box with the opening forward so that it made two shelves for the personal belongings of the occupant of the bunk.","And these shelves were loaded with little articles, soap and talcum powder, razors and those Western magazines ranch men love to read and scoff at and secretly believe.","And there were medicines on the shelves, and little vials, combs; and from nails on the box sides, a few neckties.","Near one wall there was a black cast–iron stove, its stovepipe going straight up through the ceiling.","In the middle of the room stood a big square table littered with playing cards, and around it were grouped boxes for the players to sit on.","At about ten o’clock in the morning the sun threw a bright dust–laden bar through one of the side windows, and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing stars.","The wooden latch raised.","The door opened and a tall, stoop–shouldered old man came in.","He was dressed in blue jeans and he carried a big push–broom in his left hand.","Behind him came George, and behind George, Lennie.\r\n “The boss was expectin’ you last night,” the old man said. “He was sore as hell when you wasn’t here to go out this morning.” He pointed with his right arm, and out of the sleeve came a round stick–like wrist, but no hand. “You can have them two beds there,” he said, indicating two bunks near the stove.","George stepped over and threw his blankets down on the burlap sack of straw that was a mattress.","He looked into his box shelf and then picked a small yellow can from it. “Say.","What the hell’s this?”\r\n “I don’t know,” said the old man.\r\n “Says ‘positively kills lice, roaches and other scourges.’ What the hell kind of bed you giving us, anyways.","We don’t want no pants rabbits.”\r\n The old swamper shifted his broom and held it between his elbow and his side while he held out his hand for the can.","He studied the label carefully. “Tell you what—” he said finally, “last guy that had this bed was a blacksmith—hell of a nice fella and as clean a guy as you want to meet.","Used to wash his hands evenafter he ate.”\r\n “Then how come he got graybacks?” George was working up a slow anger.","Lennie put his bindle on the neighboring bunk and sat down.","He watched George with open mouth.\r\n “Tell you what,” said the old swamper. “This here blacksmith—name of Whitey—was the kind of guy that would put that stuff around even if there

Quarters","text":[" 4\r\n4\r\nCrooks, the negro stable buck, had his bunk in the harness room; a\r\nlittle shed that leaned off the wall of the barn.","On one side of the\r\nlittle room there was a square four–paned window, and on the other, a\r\nnarrow plank door leading into the barn.","Crooks' bunk was a long box\r\nfilled with straw, on which his blankets were flung.","On the wall by the\r\nwindow there were pegs on which hung broken harness in process of being\r\nmended; strips of new leather; and under the window itself a little\r\nbench for leather–working tools, curved knives and needles and balls of\r\nlinen thread, and a small hand riveter.","On pegs were also pieces of\r\nharness, a split collar with the horsehair stuffing sticking out, a\r\nbroken hame, and a trace chain with its leather covering split.","Crooks\r\nhad his apple box over his bunk, and in it a range of medicine bottles,\r\nboth for himself and for the horses.","There were cans of saddle soap and\r\na drippy can of tar with its paint brush sticking over the edge.","And\r\nscattered about the floor were a number of personal possessions; for,\r\nbeing alone, Crooks could leave his things about, and being a stable\r\nbuck and a cripple, he was more permanent than the other men, and he had\r\naccumulated more possessions than he could carry on his back.","Crooks possessed several pairs of shoes, a pair of rubber boots, a big\r\nalarm clock and a single–barreled shotgun.","And he had books, too; a\r\ntattered dictionary and a mauled copy of the California civil code for\r\n1905.","There were battered magazines and a few dirty books on a special\r\nshelf over his bunk.","A pair of large gold–rimmed spectacles hung from a\r\nnail on the wall above his bed.","This room was swept and fairly neat, for Crooks was a proud, aloof man.","He kept his distance and demanded that other people keep theirs.","His\r\nbody was bent over to the left by his crooked spine, and his eyes lay\r\ndeep in his head, and because of their depth seemed to glitter with\r\nintensity.","His lean face was lined with deep black wrinkles, and he had\r\nthin, pain–tightened lips which were lighter than his face.","It was Saturday night.","Through the open door that led into the barn came\r\nthe sound of moving horses, of feet stirring, of teeth champing on hay,\r\nof the rattle of halter chains.","In the stable buck's room a small\r\nelectric globe threw a meager yellow light.","Crooks sat on his bunk.","His shirt was out of his jeans in back.","In one\r\nhand he held a bottle of liniment, and with the other he rubbed his\r\nspine.","Now and then he poured a few drops of the liniment into his\r\npink–palmed hand and reached up under his shirt to rub again.","He flexed\r\nhis muscles against his back and shivered.","Noiselessly Lennie appeared in the open doorway and stood there looking\r\nin, his big shoulders nearly filling the opening.","For a moment Crooks\r\ndid not see him, but on raising his eyes he stiffened and a scowl came\r\non his face.","His hand came out from under his shirt.","Lennie smiled helplessly in an attempt to make friends.","Crooks said sharply, “You got no right to come in my room.","This here's\r\nmy room.","Nobody got any right in here but me.”\r\nLennie gulped and his smile grew more fawning. “I ain't doing nothing,”\r\nhe said. “Just come to look at my puppy.","And I seen your light,” he\r\nexplained.\r\n“Well, I got a right to have a light.","You go on get outta my room.","I\r\nain't wanted in the bunk house, and you ain't wanted in my room.”\r\n“Why ain't you wanted?” Lennie asked.\r\n“'Cause I'm black.","They play cards in there, but I can't play because\r\nI'm black.","They say I stink.","Well, I tell you, you all of you stink to\r\nme.”\r\nLennie flapped his big hands helplessly. “Ever'body went into town,” he\r\nsaid. “Slim an' George an' ever'body.","George says I gotta stay here an'\r\nnot get in no trouble.","I seen your light.”\r\n“Well, what do you want?”\r\n“Nothing—I seen your light.","I thought I could jus' come in an' set.”\r\nCrooks stared at Lennie, and he reached behind him and took down the\r\nspectacles and adjusted them over his pink ears and stared again. “I\r\ndon't know what you're doin' in the barn anyway,” he complained. “You\r\nain't no skinner.","They's no call for a bucker to come into the barn at\r\nall.","You ain't no skinner.","You ain't got nothing to do with the horses.”\r\n“The pup,” Lennie repeated. “I come to see my pup.”\r\n“Well, go see your pup, then.","Don't come in a place where you're not\r\nwanted.”\r\nLennie lost his smile.","He advanced a step into the room, then remembered\r\nand backed to the door again. “I looked at 'em a little.","Slim says I\r\nain't to pet 'em very much.”\r\nCrooks said, “Well, you been takin' 'em out of the nest all the time.","I\r\nwonder the old lady don't move 'em someplace else.”\r\n“Oh, she don't care.","She lets me.” Lennie had moved into the room again.","Crooks scowled, but Lennie's disarming smile defeated him. “Come on in\r\nand set a while,” Crooks said. “'Long as you won't get out and leave me\r\nalone, you might as well set down.” His tone was a little more friendly.\r\n“All the boys gone into town, huh?”\r\n“All but old Candy.","He just sets in the bunk house sharpening his pencil\r\nand sharpening and figuring.”\r\nCrooks adjusted his glasses. “Figuring?","What's Candy figuring about?”\r\nLennie almost shouted, “'Bout the rabbits.”\r\n“You're nuts,” said Crooks. “You're crazy as a wedge.","What rabbits you\r\ntalkin' about?”\r\n“The rabbits we're gonna get, and I get to tend 'em, cut grass an' give\r\n'em water, an' like that.”\r\n“Jus' nuts,” said Crooks. “I don't blame the guy you travel with for\r\nkeepin' you outa sight.”\r\nLennie said quietly. “It ain't no lie.","We're gonna do it.","Gonna get a\r\nlittle place an' live on the fatta the lan'.”\r\nCrooks settled himself more comfortably on his bunk. “Set down,” he\r\ninvited. “Set down on the nail keg.”\r\nLennie hunched down on the little barrel. “You think it's a lie,” Lennie\r\nsaid, “But it ain't no lie.","Ever' word's the truth, an' you can ast\r\nGeorge.”\r\nCrooks put his dark chin into his pink palm. “You travel aroun' with\r\nGeorge, don't ya?”\r\n“Sure.","Me an' him goes ever' place together.”\r\nCrooks continued. “Sometimes he talks, and you don't know what the hell\r\nhe's talkin' about.","Ain't that so?” He leaned forward, boring Lennie\r\nwith his deep eyes. “Ain't that
