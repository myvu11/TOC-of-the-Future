On a fine
summer morning when the dew lay on the grass he set off with the Badger
and the two Dwarfs, up through the forest to a high saddle in the
mountains and down on to their sunny southern slopes where one looked
across the green wolds of Archenland.</p><p>"We will go first to the Three Bulgy Bears," said Trumpkin.</p><p>They came in a glade to an old hollow oak tree covered with moss, and
Trufflehunter tapped with his paw three times on the trunk and there
was no answer.  Then he tapped again and a woolly sort of voice from
inside said, "Go away.  It's not time to get up yet."  But when he
tapped the third time there was a noise like a small earthquake from
inside and a sort of door opened and out came three brown bears, very
bulgy indeed and blinking their little eyes.  And when everything had
been explained to them (which took a long time because they were so
sleepy) they said, just as Trufflehunter had said, that a son of Adam
ought to be King of Narnia and all kissed Caspian—very wet, snuffly
kisses they were—and offered him some honey.  Caspian did not really
want honey, without bread, at that time in the morning, but he thought
it polite to accept It took him a long time afterwards to get unsticky.</p><p>After that they went on till they came among tall beech trees and
Trufflehunter called out, "Pattertwig!  Pattertwig!  Pattertwig!" and
almost at once, bounding down from branch to branch till he was just
above their heads, came the most magnificent red squirrel that Caspian
had ever seen.  He was far bigger than the ordinary dumb squirrels
which he had sometimes seen in the castle gardens; indeed he was nearly
the size of a terrier and the moment you looked in his face you saw
that he could talk.  Indeed the difficulty was to get him to stop
talking, for, like all squirrels, he was a chatterer.  He welcomed
Caspian at once and asked if he would like a nut and Caspian said
thanks, he would.  But as Pattertwig went bounding away to fetch it,
Trufflehunter whispered in Caspian's ear, "Don't look.  Look the other
way.  It's very bad manners among squirrels to watch anyone going to
his store or to look as if you wanted to know where it was."  Then
Pattertwig came back with the nut and Caspian ate it and after that
Pattertwig asked if he could take any messages to other friends.  "For
I can go nearly everywhere without setting foot to ground," he said.
Trufflehunter and the Dwarfs thought this a very good idea and gave
Pattertwig messages to all sorts of people with queer names telling
them all to come to a feast and council on Dancing Lawn at midnight
three nights ahead.  "And you'd better tell the three Bulgies too,"
added Trumpkin.  "We forgot to mention it to them."</p><p>Their next visit was to the Seven Brothers of Shuddering Wood.
Trumpkin led the way back to the saddle and then down eastward on the
northern slope of the mountains till they came to a very solemn place
among rocks and fir trees.  They went very quietly and presently
Caspian could feel the ground shake under his feet as if someone were
hammering down below.  Trumpkin went to a flat stone about the size of
the top of a water–butt, and stamped on it with his foot.  After a long
pause it was moved away by someone or something underneath, and there
was a dark, round hole with a good deal of heat and steam coming out of
it and in the middle of the hole the head of a Dwarf very like Trumpkin
himself.  There was a long talk here and the Dwarf seemed more
suspicious than the Squirrel or the Bulgy Bears had been, but in the
end the whole party were invited to come down.  Caspian found himself
descending a dark stairway into the earth, but when he came to the
bottom he saw firelight.  It was the light of a furnace.  The whole
place was a smithy.  A subterranean stream ran past on one side of it.
Two Dwarfs were at the bellows, another was holding a piece of red–hot
metal on the anvil with a pair of tongs, a fourth was hammering it, and
two, wiping their horny little hands on a greasy cloth, were coming
forward to meet the visitors.  It took some time to satisfy them that
Caspian was a friend and not an enemy, but when they did, they all
cried, "Long live the King," and their gifts were noble—mail shirts
and helmets and swords for Caspian and Trumpkin and Nikabrik.  The
Badger could have had the same if he had liked, but he said he was a
beast, he was, and if his claws and teeth could not keep his skin
whole, it wasn't worth keeping.  The workmanship of the arms was far
finer than any Caspian had ever seen, and he gladly accepted the
Dwarf–made sword instead of his own, which looked, in comparison, as
feeble as a toy and as clumsy as a stick.  The seven brothers (who were
all Red Dwarfs) promised to come to the feast at Dancing Lawn.</p><p>A little farther on, in a dry, rocky ravine they reached the cave of
five Black Dwarfs.  They looked suspiciously at Caspian, but in the end
the eldest of them said, "If he is against Miraz, we'll have him for
King."  And the next oldest said, "Shall we go farther up for you, up
to the crags?  There's an Ogre or two and a Hag that we could introduce
you to, up there."</p><p>"Certainly not," said Caspian.</p><p>"I should think not, indeed," said Trufflehunter.  "We want none of
that sort on our side."  Nikabrik disagreed with this, but Trumpkin and
the Badger overruled him.  It gave Caspian a shock to realise that the
horrible creatures out of the old stories, as well as the nice ones,
had some descendants in Narnia still.</p><p>"We should not have Aslan for our friend if we brought in that rabble,"
said Trufflehunter as they came away from the cave of the Black Dwarfs.</p><p>"Oh, Aslan!" said Trumpkin, cheerily but contemptuously.  "What matters
much more is that you wouldn't have me."</p><p>"Do you believe in Aslan?" said Caspian to Nikabrik.</p><p>"I'll believe in anyone or anything," said Nikabrik, "that'll batter
these cursed Telmarine barbarians to pieces or drive them out of
Narnia.  Anyone or anything, Aslan <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> the White Witch, do you
understand?"</p><p>"Silence, silence," said Trufflehunter.  "You do not know what you are
saying.  She was a worse enemy than Miraz and all his race."</p><p>"Not to Dwarfs, she wasn't," said Nikabrik.</p><p>Their next visit was a pleasanter one.  As they came lower down, the
mountains opened out into a great glen or wooded gorge with a swift
river running at the bottom.  The open places near the river's edge
were a mass of foxgloves and wild roses and the air was buzzing with
bees.  Here Trufflehunter called again, "Glenstorm!  Glenstorm!" and
after a pause Caspian heard the sound of hoofs.  It grew louder till
the valley trembled and at last, breaking and trampling the thickets,
there came in sight the noblest creatures that Caspian had yet seen,
the great Centaur Glenstorm and his three sons.  His flanks were glossy
chestnut and the beard that covered his broad chest was golden–red.  He
was a prophet and a star–gazer and knew what they had come about.</p><p>"Long live the King," he cried.  "I and my sons are ready for war.
When is the battle to be joined?"</p><p>Up till now neither Caspian nor the others had really been thinking of
a war.  They had some vague idea, perhaps, of an occasional raid on
some Human farmstead or of attacking a party of hunters, if it ventured
too far into these southern wilds.  But, in the main, they had thought
only of living to themselves in woods and caves and building up an
attempt at Old Narnia in hiding.  As soon as Glenstorm had spoken
everyone felt much more serious.</p><p>"Do you mean a real war to drive Miraz out of Narnia?" asked Caspian.</p><p>"What else?" said the Centaur.  "Why else does your Majesty go clad in
mail and girt with sword?"</p><p>"Is it possible, Glenstorm?" said the Badger.</p><p>"The time is ripe," said Glenstorm.  "I watch the skies, Badger, for it
is mine to watch, as it is yours to remember.  Tarva and Alambil have
met in the halls of high heaven, and on earth a son of Adam has once
more arisen to rule and name the creatures.  The hour has struck.  Our
council at the Dancing Lawn must be a council of war."  He spoke in
such a voice that neither Caspian nor the others hesitated for a
moment: it now seemed to them quite possible that they might win a war
and quite certain that they must wage one.</p><p>As it was now past the middle of the day, they rested with the Centaurs
and ate such food as the Centaurs provided—cakes of oaten meal, and
apples, and herbs, and wine, and cheese.</p><p>The next place they were to visit was quite near at hand, but they had
to go a long way round in order to avoid a region in which Men lived.
It was well into the afternoon before they found themselves in level
fields, warm between hedgerows.  There Trufflehunter called at the
mouth of a little hole in a green bank and out popped the last thing
Caspian expected—a Talking Mouse.  He was of course bigger than a
common mouse, well over a foot high when he stood on his hind legs, and
with ears nearly as long (though broader) than a rabbit's.  His name
was Reepicheep and he was a gay and martial mouse.  He wore a tiny
little rapier at his side and twirled his long whiskers as if they were
a moustache.  "There are twelve of us, Sire," he said with a dashing
and graceful bow, "and I place all the resources of my people
unreservedly at your Majesty's disposal."  Caspian tried hard (and
successfully) not to laugh, but he couldn't help thinking that
Reepicheep and all his people could very easily be put in a washing
basket and carried home on one's back.</p><p>It would take too long to mention all the creatures whom Caspian met
that day—Clodsley Shovel the Mole, the three Hardbiters (who were
badgers like Trufflehunter), Camillo the Hare, and Hogglestock the
Hedgehog.  They rested at last beside a well at the edge of a wide and
level circle of grass, bordered with tall elms which now threw long
shadows across it, for the sun was setting, the daisies closing, and
the rooks flying home to bed.  Here they supped on food they had
brought with them and Trumpkin lit his pipe (Nikabrik was not a smoker).</p><p>"Now," said the Badger, "if only we could wake the spirits of these
trees and this well, we should have done a good day's work."</p><p>"Can't we?" said Caspian.</p><p>"No," said Trufflehunter.  "We have no power over them.  Since the
Humans came into the land, felling forests and defiling streams, the
Dryads and Naiads have sunk into a deep sleep.  Who knows if ever they
will stir again?  And that is a great loss to our side.  The Telmarines
are horribly afraid of the woods, and once the Trees moved in anger,
our enemies would go mad with fright and be chased out of Narnia as
quick as their legs could carry them."</p><p>"What imaginations you Animals have!" said Trumpkin, who didn't believe
in such things.  "But why stop at Trees and Waters?  Wouldn't it be
even nicer if the stones started throwing themselves at old Miraz?"</p><p>The Badger only grunted at this, and after that there was such a
silence that Caspian had nearly dropped off to sleep when he thought he
heard a faint musical sound from the depth of the woods at his back.
Then he thought it was only a dream and turned over again; but as soon
as his ear touched the ground he felt or heard (it was hard to tell
which) a faint beating or drumming.  He raised his head.  The beating
noise at once became fainter, but the music returned, clearer this
time.  It was like flutes.  He saw that Trufflehunter was sitting up
staring into the wood.  The moon was bright; Caspian had been asleep
longer than he thought.  Nearer and nearer came the music, a tune wild
and yet dreamy, and the noise of many light feet, till at last, out
from the wood into the moonlight, came dancing shapes such as Caspian
had been thinking of all his life.  They were not much taller than
Dwarfs, but far slighter and more graceful.  Their curly heads had
little horns, the upper part of their bodies gleamed naked in the pale
light, but their legs and feet were those of goats.</p><p>"Fauns!" cried Caspian, jumping up, and in a moment they were all round
him.  It took next to no time to explain the whole situation to them
and they accepted Caspian at once.  Before he knew what he was doing he
found himself joining in the dance.  Trumpkin, with heavier and jerkier
movements, did likewise and even Trufflehunter hopped and lumbered
about as best he could.  Only Nikabrik stayed where he was, looking on
in silence.  The Fauns footed it all round Caspian to their reedy
pipes.  Their strange faces, which seemed mournful and merry all at
once, looked into his; dozens of Fauns, Mentius and Obentinus and
Dumnus, Voluns, Voltinus, Girbius, Nimienus, Nausus and Oscuns.
Pattertwig had sent them all.</p><p>When Caspian awoke next morning he could hardly believe that it had not
all been a dream; but the grass was covered with little cloven
hoof–marks.</p></section><footer/></body></html>
