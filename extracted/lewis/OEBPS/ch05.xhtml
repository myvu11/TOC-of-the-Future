the top of the Great Tower, and at each conversation Caspian learned
more about Old Narnia, so that thinking and dreaming about the old
days, and longing that they might come back, filled nearly all his
spare hours.  But of course he had not many hours to spare, for now his
education was beginning in earnest.  He learned sword–fighting and
riding, swimming and diving, how to shoot with the bow and play on the
recorder and the theorbo, how to hunt the stag and cut him up when he
was dead, besides Cosmography, Rhetoric, Heraldry, Versification, and
of course History, with a little Law, Physic, Alchemy and Astronomy.
Of Magic he learned only the theory, for Doctor Cornelius said the
practical part was not a proper study for princes.  "And I myself," he
added, "am only a very imperfect magician and can do only the smallest
experiments."  Of Navigation ("Which is a noble and heroical art," said
the Doctor) he was taught nothing, because King Miraz disapproved of
ships and the sea.</p><p>He also learned a great deal by using his own eyes and ears.  As a
little boy he had often wondered why he disliked his aunt, Queen
Prunaprismia; he now saw that it was because she disliked him.  He also
began to see that Narnia was an unhappy country.  The taxes were high
and the laws were stern and Miraz was a cruel man.</p><p>After some years there came a time when the Queen seemed to be ill and
there was a great deal of bustle and pother about her in the castle and
doctors came and the courtiers whispered.  This was in early
summertime.  And one night, while all this fuss was going on, Caspian
was unexpectedly wakened by Doctor Cornelius after he had been only a
few hours in bed.</p><p>"Are we going to do a little Astronomy, Doctor?" said Caspian.</p><p>"Hush!" said the Doctor.  "Trust me and do exactly as I tell you.  Put
on all your clothes; you have a long journey before you."</p><p>Caspian was very surprised, but he had learned to have confidence in
his Tutor and he began doing what he was told at once.  When he was
dressed the Doctor said, "I have a wallet for you.  We must go into the
next room and fill it with victuals from your Highness's supper table."</p><p>"My gentlemen–in–waiting will be there," said Caspian.</p><p>"They are fast asleep and will not wake," said the Doctor.  "I am a
very minor magician but I can at least contrive a charmed sleep."</p><p>They went into the antechamber and there, sure enough, the two
gentlemen–in–waiting were, sprawling on chairs and snoring hard.
Doctor Cornelius quickly cut up the remains of a cold chicken and some
slices of venison and put them, with bread and an apple or so and a
little flask of good wine, into the wallet which he then gave to
Caspian.  It fitted on by a strap over Caspian's shoulder, like a
satchel you would use for taking books to school.</p><p>"Have you your sword?" asked the Doctor.</p><p>"Yes," said Caspian.</p><p>"Then put this mantle over all to hide the sword and the wallet.
That's right.  And now we must go to the Great Tower and talk."</p><p>When they had reached the top of the Tower (it was a cloudy night, not
at all like the night when they had seen the conjunction of Tarva and
Alambil) Doctor Cornelius said,</p><p>"Dear Prince, you must leave this castle at once and go to seek your
fortune in the wide world.  Your life is in danger here."</p><p>"Why?  asked Caspian.</p><p>"Because you are the true King of Narnia: Caspian the Tenth, the true
son and heir of Caspian the Ninth.  Long life to your Majesty"—and
suddenly, to Caspian's great surprise, the little man dropped down on
one knee and kissed his hand.</p><p>"What does it all mean?  I don't understand," said Caspian.</p><p>"I wonder you have never asked me before," said the Doctor, "why, being
the son of King Caspian, you are not King Caspian yourself.  Everyone
except your Majesty knows that Miraz is a usurper.  When he first began
to rule he did not even pretend to be the King: he called himself Lord
Protector.  But then your royal mother died, the good Queen and the
only Telmarine who was ever kind to me.  And then, one by one, all the
great lords, who had known your father, died or disappeared.  Not by
accident, either.  Miraz weeded them out.  Belisar and Uvilas were shot
with arrows on a hunting party: by chance, it was pretended.  All the
great house of the Passarids he sent to fight giants on the northern
frontier till one by one they fell.  Arlian and Erimon and a dozen more
he executed for treason on a false charge.  The two brothers of
Beaversdam he shut up as madmen.  And finally he persuaded the seven
noble lords, who alone among all the Telmarines did not fear the sea,
to sail away and look for new lands beyond the Eastern Ocean, and, as
he intended, they never came back.  And when there was no one left who
could speak a word for you, then his flatterers (as he had instructed
them) begged him to become King.  And of course he did."</p><p>"Do you mean he now wants to kill me too?" said Caspian.</p><p>"That is almost certain," said Doctor Cornelius.</p><p>"But why now?" said Caspian.  "I mean, why didn't he do it long ago if
he wanted to?  And what harm have I done him?"</p><p>"He has changed his mind about you because of something that happened
only two hours ago.  The Queen has had a son."</p><p>"I don't see what that's got to do with it," said Caspian.</p><p>"Don't see!" exclaimed the Doctor.  "Have all my lessons in History and
Politics taught you no more than that?  Listen.  As long as he had no
children of his own, he was willing enough that you should be King
after he died.  He may not have cared much about you, but he would
rather you should have the throne than a stranger.  Now that he has a
son of his own he will want his own son to be the next King.  You are
in the way.  He'll clear you out of the way."</p><p>"Is he really as bad as that?" said Caspian.  "Would he really murder
me?"</p><p>"He murdered your Father," said Doctor Cornelius.</p><p>Caspian felt very queer and said nothing.</p><p>"I can tell you the whole story," said the Doctor.  "But not now.
There is no time.  You must fly at once."</p><p>"You'll come with me?" said Caspian.</p><p>"I dare not," said the Doctor.  "It would make your danger greater.
Two are more easily tracked than one.  Dear Prince, dear King Caspian,
you must be very brave.  You must go alone and at once.  Try to get
across the southern border to the court of King Nain of Archenland.  He
will be good to you."</p><p>"Shall I never see you again?" said Caspian in a quavering voice.</p><p>"I hope so, dear King," said the Doctor.  "What friend have I in the
wide world except your Majesty?  And I have a little magic.  But in the
meantime, speed is everything.  Here are two gifts before you go.  This
is a little purse of gold—alas, all the treasure in this castle should
be your own by rights.  And here is something far better."</p><p>He put in Caspian's hands something which he could hardly see but which
he knew by the feel to be a horn.</p><p>"That," said Doctor Cornelius, "is the greatest and most sacred
treasure of Narnia.  Many terrors I endured, many spells did I utter,
to find it, when I was still young.  It is the magic horn of Queen
Susan herself which she left behind her when she vanished from Narnia
at the end of the Golden Age.  It is said that whoever blows it shall
have strange help—no one can say how strange.  It may have power to
call Queen Lucy and King Edmund and Queen Susan and the High King Peter
back from the past, and they will set all to rights.  It may be that it
will call up Aslan himself.  Take it, King Caspian: but do not use it
except at your greatest need.  And now, haste, haste, haste.  The
little door at the very bottom of the Tower, the door into the garden,
is unlocked.  There we must part."</p><p>"Can't I get my horse Destrier?" said Caspian.</p><p>"He is already saddled and waiting for you just at the corner of the
orchard."</p><p>During the long climb down the winding staircase Cornelius whispered
many more words of direction and advice.  Caspian's heart was sinking,
but he tried to take it all in.  Then came the fresh air in the garden,
a fervent handclasp with the Doctor, a run across the lawn, a welcoming
whinny from Destrier, and so King Caspian the Tenth left the castle of
his fathers.  Looking back, he saw fireworks going up to celebrate the
birth of the new prince.</p><p>All night he rode southward, choosing by–ways and bridle paths through
woods as long as he was in country that he knew; but afterwards he kept
to the high road.  Destrier was as excited as his master at this
unusual journey, and Caspian, though tears had come into his eyes at
saying good–bye to Doctor Cornelius, felt brave and, in a way, happy,
to think that he was King Caspian riding to seek adventures, with his
sword on his left hip and Queen Susan's magic horn on his right.  But
when day came, with a sprinkle of rain, and he looked about him and saw
on every side unknown woods, wild heaths and blue mountains, he thought
how large and strange the world was and felt frightened and small.</p><p>As soon as it was full daylight he left the road and found an open
grassy place amid a wood where he could rest.  He took off Destrier's
bridle and let him graze, ate some cold chicken and drank a little
wine, and presently fell asleep.  It was late afternoon when he awoke.
He ate a morsel and continued his journey, still southward, by many
unfrequented lanes.  He was now in a land of hills, going up and down,
but always more up than down.  From every ridge he could see the
mountains growing bigger and blacker ahead.  As the evening closed in,
he was riding their lower slopes.  The wind rose.  Soon rain fell in
torrents.  Destrier became uneasy; there was thunder in the air.  And
now they entered a dark and seemingly endless pine forest, and all the
stories Caspian had ever heard of trees being unfriendly to Man crowded
into his mind.  He remembered that he was, after all, a Telmarine, one
of the race who cut down trees wherever they could and were at war with
all wild things; and though he himself might be unlike other
Telmarines, the trees could not be expected to know this.</p><p>Nor did they.  The wind became a tempest, the woods roared and creaked
all round him.  There came a crash.  A tree fell right across the road
just behind him.  "Quiet, Destrier, quiet!" said Caspian, patting his
horse's neck; but he was trembling himself and knew that he had escaped
death by an inch.  Lightning flashed and a great crack of thunder
seemed to break the sky in two just overhead.  Destrier bolted in good
earnest.  Caspian was a good rider, but he had not the strength to hold
him back.  He kept his seat, but he knew that his life hung by a thread
during the wild career that followed.  Tree after tree rose up before
them in the dusk and was only just avoided.  Then, almost too suddenly
to hurt (and yet it did hurt him too) something struck Caspian on the
forehead and he knew no more.</p><p>When he came to himself he was lying in a firelit place with bruised
limbs and a bad headache.  Low voices were speaking close at hand.</p><p>"And now," said one, "before it wakes up we must decide what to do with
it."</p><p>"Kill it," said another.  "We can't let it live.  It would betray us."</p><p>"We ought to have killed it at once, or else let it alone," said a
third voice.  "We can't kill it now.  Not after we've taken it in and
bandaged its head and all.  It would be murdering a guest."</p><p>"Gentlemen," said Caspian in a feeble voice, "whatever you do to me, I
hope you will be kind to my poor horse."</p><p>"Your horse had taken flight long before we found you," said the first
voice—a curiously husky, earthy voice, as Caspian now noticed.</p><p>"Now don't let it talk you round with its pretty words," said the
second voice.  "I still say―"</p><p>"Horns and halibuts!" exclaimed the third voice.  "Of course we're not
going to murder it.  For shame, Nikabrik.  What do you say,
Trufflehunter?  What shall we do with it?"</p><p>"I shall give it a drink," said the first voice, presumably
Trufflehunter's.  A dark shape approached the bed.  Caspian felt an arm
slipped gently under his shoulders—if it was exactly an arm.  The
shape somehow seemed wrong.  The face that bent towards him seemed
wrong too.  He got the impression that it was very hairy and very long
nosed, and there were odd white patches on each side of it.  "It's a
mask of some sort," thought Caspian.  "Or perhaps I'm in a fever and
imagining it all."  A cupful of something sweet and hot was set to his
lips and he drank.  At that moment one of the others poked the fire.  A
blaze sprang up and Caspian almost screamed with the shock as the
sudden light revealed the face that was looking into his own.  It was
not a man's face but a badger's, though larger and friendlier and more
intelligent than the face of any badger he had seen before.  And it had
certainly been talking.  He saw, too, that he was on a bed of heather,
in a cave.  By the fire sat two little bearded men, so much wilder and
shorter and hairier and thicker than Doctor Cornelius that he knew them
at once for real Dwarfs, ancient Dwarfs with not a drop of human blood
in their veins.  And Caspian knew that he had found the Old Narnians at
last.  Then his head began to swim again.</p><p>In the next few days he learned to know them by names.  The Badger was
called Trufflehunter; he was the oldest and kindest of the three.  The
Dwarf who had wanted to kill Caspian was a sour Black Dwarf (that is,
his hair and beard were black, and thick and hard like horse–hair).
His name was Nikabrik.  The other Dwarf was a Red Dwarf with hair
rather like a Fox's and he was called Trumpkin.</p><p>"And now," said Nikabrik on the first evening when Caspian was well
enough to sit up and talk, "we still have to decide what to do with
this Human.  You two think you've done it a great kindness by not
letting me kill it.  But I suppose the upshot is that we have to keep
it a prisoner for life.  I'm certainly not going to let it go alive—to
go back to its own kind and betray us all."</p><p>"Bulbs and bolsters!  Nikabrik," said Trumpkin.  "Why need you talk so
unhandsomely?  It isn't the creature's fault that it bashed its head
against a tree outside our hole.  And I don't think it looks like a
traitor."</p><p>"I say," said Caspian, "you haven't yet found out whether I <span class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> to
go back.  I don't.  I want to stay with you—if you'll let me.  I've
been looking for people like you all my life."</p><p>"That's a likely story," growled Nikabrik.  "You're a Telmarine and a
Human, aren't you?  Of course you want to go back to your own kind."</p><p>"Well, even if I did, I couldn't," said Caspian.  "I was flying for my
life when I had my accident.  The King wants to kill me.  If you'd
killed me, you'd have done the very thing to please him."</p><p>"Well now," said Trufflehunter, "you don't say so!"</p><p>"Eh?" said Trumpkin.  "What's that?  What have you been doing, Human,
to fall foul of Miraz at your age?"</p><p>"He's my uncle," began Caspian, when Nikabrik jumped up with his hand
on his dagger.</p><p>"There you are!" he cried.  "Not only a Telmarine but close kin and
heir to our greatest enemy.  Are you still mad enough to let this
creature live?"  He would have stabbed Caspian then and there, if the
Badger and Trumpkin had not got in the way and forced him back to his
seat and held him down.</p><p>"Now, once and for all, Nikabrik," said Trumpkin.  "Will you contain
yourself, or must Trufflehunter and I sit on your head?"</p><p>Nikabrik sulkily promised to behave, and the other two asked Caspian to
tell his whole story.  When he had done so there was a moment's silence.</p><p>"This is the queerest thing I ever heard," said Trumpkin.</p><p>"I don't like it," said Nikabrik.  "I didn't know there were stories
about us still told among the Humans.  The less they know about us the
better.  That old nurse, now.  She'd better have held her tongue.  And
it's all mixed up with that Tutor: a renegade Dwarf.  I hate 'em.  I
hate 'em worse than the Humans.  You mark my words—no good will come
of it."</p><p>"Don't you go talking about things you don't understand, Nikabrik,"
said Trufflehunter.  "You Dwarfs are as forgetful and changeable as the
Humans themselves.  I'm a beast, I am, and a Badger what's more.  We
don't change.  We hold on.  I say great good will come of it.  This is
the true King of Narnia we've got here: a true King, coming back to
true Narnia.  And we beasts remember, even if Dwarfs forget, that
Narnia was never right except when a son of Adam was King."</p><p>"Whistles and whirligigs!  Trufflehunter," said Trumpkin.  "You don't
mean you want to give the country to Humans?"</p><p>"I said nothing about that," answered the Badger.  "It's not Men's
country (who should know that better than me?) but it's a country for a
man to be King of.  We badgers have long enough memories to know that.
Why, bless us all, wasn't the High King Peter a Man?"</p><p>"Do you believe all those old stories?" asked Trumpkin.</p><p>"I tell you, we don't change, we beasts," said Trufflehunter.  "We
don't forget.  I believe in the High King Peter and the rest that
reigned at Cair Paravel, as firmly as I believe in Aslan himself."</p><p>"As firmly as <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span>, I dare say," said Trumpkin.  "But who believes in
Aslan nowadays?"</p><p>"I do," said Caspian.  "And if I hadn't believed in him before, I would
now.  Back there among the Humans the people who laughed at Aslan would
have laughed at stories about Talking Beasts and Dwarfs.  Sometimes I
did wonder if there really was such a person as Aslan: but then
sometimes I wondered if there were really people like you.  Yet there
you are."</p><p>"That's right," said Trufflehunter.  "You're right, King Caspian.  And
as long as you will be true to Old Narnia you shall be <span class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> King,
whatever they say.  Long life to your Majesty."</p><p>"You make me sick, Badger," growled Nikabrik.  "The High King Peter and
the rest may have been Men, but they were a different sort of Men.
This is one of the cursed Telmarines.  He has <span class="emphasis"><em>hunted</em></span> beasts for
sport.  Haven't you, now?" he added, rounding suddenly on Caspian.</p><p>"Well, to tell you the truth, I have," said Caspian.  "But they weren't
Talking Beasts."</p><p>"It's all the same thing," said Nikabrik.</p><p>"No, no, no," said Trufflehunter.  "You know it isn't.  You know very
well that the beasts in Narnia nowadays are different and are no more
than the poor dumb, witless creatures you'd find in Kalormen or Telmar.
They're smaller too.  They're far more different from us than the
half–Dwarfs are from you."</p><p>There was a great deal more talk, but it all ended with the agreement
that Caspian should stay and even the promise that, as soon as he was
able to go out, he should be taken to see what Trumpkin called "the
Others"; for apparently in these wild parts all sorts of creatures from
the Old Days of Narnia still lived on in hiding.</p></section><footer/></body></html>
