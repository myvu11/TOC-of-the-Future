colour of cold gravy, their knees knocked together, and many fell on
their faces.  They had not believed in lions and this made their fear
greater.  Even the Red Dwarfs, who knew that he came as a friend, stood
with open mouths and could not speak.  Some of the Black Dwarfs, who
had been of Nikabrik's party, began to edge away.  But all the Talking
Beasts surged round the Lion, with purrs and grunts and squeaks and
whinneys of delight, fawning on him with their tails, rubbing against
him, touching him reverently with their noses and going to and fro
under his body and between his legs.  If you have ever seen a little
cat loving a big dog whom it knows and trusts, you will have a pretty
good picture of their behaviour.  Then Peter, leading Caspian, forced
his way through the crowd of animals.</p><p>"This is Caspian, Sir," he said.  And Caspian knelt and kissed the
Lion's paw.</p><p>"Welcome, Prince," said Aslan.  "Do you feel yourself sufficient to
take up the Kingship of Narnia?"</p><p>"I—I don't think I do, Sir," said Caspian.  "I'm only a kid."</p><p>"Good," said Aslan.  "If you had felt yourself sufficient, it would
have been a proof that you were not.  Therefore, under us and under the
High King, you shall be King of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel and
Emperor of the Lone Islands.  You and your heirs while your race lasts.
And your coronation—but what have we here?"  For at that moment a
curious little procession was approaching—eleven Mice, six of whom
carried between them something on a litter made of branches, but the
litter was no bigger than a large atlas.  No–one has ever seen mice
more woebegone than these.  They were plastered with mud—some with
blood too—and their ears were down and their whiskers drooped and
their tails dragged in the grass, and their leader piped on his slender
pipe a melancholy tune.  On the litter lay what seemed little better
than a damp heap of fur; all that was left of Reepicheep.  He was still
breathing, but more dead than alive, gashed with innumerable wounds,
one paw crushed, and, where his tail had been, a bandaged stump.</p><p>"Now, Lucy," said Aslan.</p><p>Lucy had her diamond bottle out in a moment.  Though only a drop was
needed on each of Reepicheep's wounds, the wounds were so many that
there was a long and anxious silence before she had finished and the
Master Mouse sprang from the litter.  His hand went at once to his
sword hilt, with the other he twirled his whiskers.  He bowed.</p><p>"Hail, Aslan!" came his shrill voice.  "I have the honour―" But then
he suddenly stopped.</p><p>The fact was that he still had no tail—whether that Lucy had forgotten
it or that her cordial, though it could heal wounds, could not make
things grow again.  Reepicheep became aware of his loss as he made his
bow; perhaps it altered something in his balance.  He looked over his
right shoulder.  Failing to see his tail, he strained his neck further
till he had to turn his shoulders and his whole body followed.  But by
that time his hind quarters had turned too and were out of sight.  Then
he strained his neck looking over his shoulder again, with the same
result.  Only after he had turned completely round three times did he
realise the dreadful truth.</p><p>"I am confounded," said Reepicheep to Aslan.  "I am completely out of
countenance.  I must crave your indulgence for appearing in this
unseemly fashion."</p><p>"It becomes you very well, Small One," said Aslan.</p><p>"All the same," replied Reepicheep, "if anything could be done … 
Perhaps her Majesty?" and here he bowed to Lucy.</p><p>"But what do you want with a tail?" asked Aslan.</p><p>"Sir," said the Mouse, "I can eat and sleep and die for my King without
one.  But a tail is the honour and glory of a Mouse."</p><p>"I have sometimes wondered, friend," said Aslan, "whether you do not
think too much about your honour."</p><p>"Highest of all High Kings," said Reepicheep, "permit me to remind you
that a very small size has been bestowed on us Mice, and if we did not
guard our dignity, some (who weigh worth by inches) would allow
themselves very unsuitable pleasantries at our expense.  That is why I
have been at some pains to make it known that no–one who does not wish
to feel this sword as near his heart as I can reach shall talk in my
presence about Traps or Toasted Cheese or Candles: no, Sir—not the
tallest fool in Narnia!"  Here he glared very fiercely up at
Wimbleweather, but the Giant, who was always a stage behind everyone
else, had not yet discovered what was being talked about down at his
feet, and so missed the point.</p><p>"Why have your followers all drawn <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> swords, may I ask?" said
Aslan.</p><p>"May it please your High Majesty," said the second Mouse, whose name
was Peepiceek, "we are all waiting to cut off our own tails if our
Chief must go without his.  We will not bear the shame of wearing an
honour which is denied to the High Mouse."</p><p>"Ah!" roared Aslan.  "You have conquered me.  You have great hearts.
Not for the sake of your dignity, Reepicheep, but for the love that is
between you and your people, and still more for the kindness your
people showed me long ago when you ate away the cords that bound me on
the Stone Table (and it was then, though you have long forgotten it,
that you began to be <span class="emphasis"><em>Talking</em></span> Mice), you shall have your tail again."</p><p>Before Aslan had finished speaking the new tail was in its place.
Then, at Aslan's command, Peter bestowed the Knighthood of the Order of
the Lion on Caspian, and Caspian, as soon as he was knighted, himself
bestowed it on Trufflehunter and Trumpkin and Reepicheep, and made
Doctor Cornelius his Lord Chancellor, and confirmed the Bulgy Bear in
his hereditary office of Marshal of the Lists.  And there was great
applause.</p><p>After this the Telmarine soldiers, firmly but without taunts or blows,
were taken across the ford and all put under lock and key in the town
of Beruna and given beef and beer.  They made a great fuss about wading
the river, for they all hated and feared running water just as much as
they hated and feared woods and animals.  But in the end the nuisance
was over: and then the nicest part of that long day began.</p><p>Lucy, sitting close to Aslan and divinely comfortable, wondered what
the trees were doing.  At first she thought they were merely dancing;
they were certainly going round slowly in two circles, one from left to
right and the other from right to left.  Then she noticed that they
kept throwing something down in the centre of both circles.  Sometimes
she thought they were cutting off long strands of their hair; at other
times it looked as if they were breaking off bits of their
fingers—but, if so, they had plenty of fingers to spare and it did not
hurt them.  But whatever they were throwing down, when it reached the
ground, it became brushwood or dry sticks.  Then three or four of the
Red Dwarfs came forward with their tinder boxes and set light to the
pile, which first crackled, and then blazed, and finally roared as a
woodland bonfire on midsummer night ought to do.  And everyone sat down
in a wide circle around it.</p><p>Then Bacchus and Silenus and the Maenads began a dance, far wilder than
the dance of the trees; not merely a dance for fun and beauty (though
it was that too) but a magic dance of plenty, and where their hands
touched, and where their feet fell, the feast came into
existence—sides of roasted meat that filled the grove with delicious
smell, and wheaten cakes and oaten cakes, honey and many–coloured
sugars and cream as thick as porridge and as smooth as still water,
peaches, nectarines, pomegranates, pears, grapes, strawberries,
raspberries—pyramids and cataracts of fruit.  Then, in great wooden
cups and bowls and mazers, wreathed with ivy, came the wines; dark,
thick ones like syrups of mulberry juice, and clear red ones like red
jellies liquefied, and yellow wines and green wines and yellowy–green
and greenish–yellow.</p><p>But for the tree people different fare was provided.  When Lucy saw
Clodsley Shovel and his moles scuffling up the turf in various places
(which Bacchus had pointed out to them) and realised that the trees
were going to eat <span class="emphasis"><em>earth</em></span> it gave her rather a shudder.  But when she
saw the earths that were actually brought to them she felt quite
different.  They began with a rich brown loam that looked almost
exactly like chocolate; so like chocolate, in fact, that Edmund tried a
piece of it, but he did not find it at all nice.  When the rich loam
had taken the edge off their hunger, the trees turned to an earth of
the kind you see in Somerset, which is almost pink.  They said it was
lighter and sweeter.  At the cheese stage they had a chalky soil, and
then went on to delicate confections of the finest gravels powdered
with choice silver sand.  They drank very little wine, and it made the
Hollies very talkative: for the most part they quenched their thirst
with deep draughts of mingled dew and rain, flavoured with forest
flowers and the airy taste of the thinnest clouds.</p><p>Thus Aslan feasted the Narnians till long after the sunset had died
away, and the stars had come out; and the great fire, now hotter but
less noisy, shone like a beacon in the dark woods, and the frightened
Telmarines saw it from far away and wondered what it might mean.  The
best thing of all about this feast was that there was no breaking up or
going away, but as the talk grew quieter and slower, one after another
would begin to nod and finally drop off to sleep with feet towards the
fire and good friends on either side, till at last there was silence
all round the circle, and the chattering of water over stone at the
Fords of Beruna could be heard once more.  But all night Aslan and the
Moon gazed upon each other with joyful and unblinking eyes.</p><p>Next day messengers (who were chiefly squirrels and birds) were sent
all over the country with a proclamation to the scattered
Telmarines—including, of course, the prisoners in Beruna.  They were
told that Caspian was now King and that Narnia would henceforth belong
to the Talking Beasts and the Dwarfs and Dryads and Fauns and other
creatures quite as much as to the men.  Any who chose to stay under the
new conditions might do so; but for those who did not like the idea,
Aslan would provide another home.  Anyone who wished to go there must
come to Aslan and the Kings at the Fords of Beruna by noon on the fifth
day.  You may imagine that this caused plenty of head–scratching among
the Telmarines.  Some of them, chiefly the young ones, had, like
Caspian, heard stories of the Old Days and were delighted that they had
come back.  They were already making friends with the creatures.  These
all decided to stay in Narnia.  But most of the older men, especially
those who had been important under Miraz, were sulky and had no wish to
live in a country where they could not rule the roast.  "Live here with
a lot of blooming performing animals!  No fear," they said.  "And
ghosts too," some added with a shudder.  "That's what those there
Dryads really are.  It's not canny."  They were also suspicious.  "I
don't trust 'em," they said.  "Not with that awful Lion and all.  He
won't keep his claws off us long, <span class="emphasis"><em>you'll</em></span> see."  But then they were
equally suspicious of his offer to give them a new home.  "Take us off
to his den and eat us one by one most likely," they muttered.  And the
more they talked to one another the sulkier and more suspicious they
became.  But on the appointed day more than half of them turned up.</p><p>At one end of the glade Aslan had caused to be set up two stakes of
wood, higher than a man's head and about three feet apart.  A third,
and lighter, piece of wood was bound across them at the top uniting
them, so that the whole thing looked like a doorway from nowhere into
nowhere.  In front of this stood Aslan himself with Peter on his right
and Caspian on his left.  Grouped round them were Susan and Lucy,
Trumpkin and Trufflehunter, the Lord Cornelius, Glenstorm, Reepicheep
and others.  The children and the Dwarfs had made good use of the royal
wardrobes in what had been the castle of Miraz and was now the castle
of Caspian, and what with silk and cloth of gold, with snowy linen
glancing through slashed sleeves, with silver mail shirts and jewelled
sword–hilts, with gilt helmets and feathered bonnets, they were almost
too bright to look at.  Even the beasts wore rich chains about their
necks.  Yet nobody's eyes were on them or the children.  The living and
strokable gold of Aslan's mane outshone them all.  The rest of the Old
Narnians stood down each side of the glade.  At the far end stood the
Telmarines.  The sun shone brightly and pennants fluttered in the light
wind.</p><p>"Men of Telmar," said Aslan, "you who seek a new land, hear my words.
I will send you all to your own country, which I know and you do not."</p><p>"We don't remember Telmar.  We don't know where it is.  We don't know
what it is like," grumbled the Telmarines.</p><p>"You came into Narnia out of Telmar," said Aslan.  "But you came into
Telmar from another place.  You do not belong to this world at all.
You came hither, certain generations ago, out of that same world to
which the High King Peter belongs."</p><p>At this, half the Telmarines began whimpering, "There you are.  Told
you so.  He's going to kill us all, send us right out of the world,"
and the other half began throwing out their chests and slapping one
another on the back and whispering, "There you are.  Might have guessed
we didn't belong to this place with all its queer, nasty, unnatural
creatures.  We're of royal blood, you'll see."  And even Caspian and
Cornelius and the children turned to Aslan with looks of amazement on
their faces.</p><p>"Peace," said Aslan in the low voice which was nearest to his growl.
The earth seemed to shake a little and every living thing in the grove
became still as stone.</p><p>"You, Sir Caspian," said Aslan, "might have known that you could be no
true King of Narnia unless, like the Kings of old, you were a son of
Adam and came from the world of Adam's sons.  And so you are.  Many
years ago in that world, in a deep sea of that world which is called
the South Sea, a shipload of pirates were driven by storm on an island.
And there they did as pirates would: killed the natives and took the
native women for wives, and made palm wine, and drank and were drunk,
and lay in the shade of the palm trees, and woke up and quarrelled, and
sometimes killed one another.  And in one of these frays six were put
to flight by the rest and fled with their women into the centre of the
island and up a mountain, and went, as they thought, into a cave to
hide.  But it was one of the magical places of that world, one of the
chinks or chasms between that world and this.  There were many chinks
or chasms between worlds in old times, but they have grown rarer.  This
was one of the last: I do not say <span class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> last.  And so they fell, or
rose, or blundered, or dropped right through, and found themselves in
this world, in the Land of Telmar which was then unpeopled.  But why it
was unpeopled is a long story: I will not tell it now.  And in Telmar
their descendants lived and became a fierce and proud people; and after
many generations there was a famine in Telmar and they invaded Narnia,
which was then in some disorder (but that also would be a long story),
and conquered it and ruled it.  Do you mark all this well, King
Caspian?"</p><p>"I do indeed, Sir," said Caspian.  "I was wishing that I came of a more
honourable lineage."</p><p>"You come of the Lord Adam and the Lady Eve," said Aslan.  "And that is
both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar, and shame
enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth.  Be
content."</p><p>Caspian bowed.</p><p>"And now," said Aslan, "you men and women of Telmar, will you go back
to that island in the world of men from which your fathers first came?
It is no bad place.  The race of those pirates who first found it has
died out, and it is without inhabitants.  There are good wells of fresh
water, and fruitful soil, and timber for building, and fish in the
lagoons; and the other men of that world have not yet discovered it.
The chasm is open for your return; but this I must warn you, that once
you have gone through, it will close behind you for ever.  There will
be no more commerce between the worlds by that door."</p><p>There was silence for a moment.  Then a burly, decent–looking fellow
among the Telmarine soldiers pushed forward and said:</p><p>"Well, I'll take the offer."</p><p>"It is well chosen," said Aslan.  "And because you have spoken first,
strong magic is upon you.  Your future in that world shall be good.
Come forth."</p><p>The man, now a little pale, came forward.  Aslan and his court drew
aside, leaving him free access to the empty doorway of the stakes.</p><p>"Go through it, my son," said Aslan, bending towards him and touching
the man's nose with his own.  As soon as the Lion's breath came about
him, a new look came into the man's eyes—startled, but not unhappy—as
if he were trying to remember something.  Then he squared his shoulders
and walked into the Door.</p><p>Everyone's eyes were fixed on him.  They saw the three pieces of wood,
and through them the trees and grass and sky of Narnia.  They saw the
man between the doorposts: then, in one second, he had vanished utterly.</p><p>From the other end of the glade the remaining Telmarines set up a
wailing.  "Ugh!  What's happened to him?  Do you mean to murder us?  We
won't go that way."  And then one of the clever Telmarines said:</p><p>"We don't see any other world through those sticks.  If you want us to
believe in it, why doesn't one of <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> go?  All your own friends are
keeping well away from the sticks."</p><p>Instantly Reepicheep stood forward and bowed.  "If <span class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> example can be
of any service, Aslan," he said, "I will take eleven mice through that
arch at your bidding without a moment's delay."</p><p>"Nay, little one," said Aslan, laying his velvety paw ever so lightly
on Reepicheep's head.  "They would do dreadful things to you in that
world.  They would show you at fairs.  It is others who must lead."</p><p>"Come on," said Peter suddenly to Edmund and Lucy.  "Our time's up."</p><p>"What do you mean?" said Edmund.</p><p>"This way," said Susan, who seemed to know all about it.  "Back into
the trees.  We've got to change."</p><p>"Change what?" asked Lucy.</p><p>"Our clothes, of course," said Susan.  "Nice fools we'd look on the
platform of an English station in <span class="emphasis"><em>these</em></span>."</p><p>"But our other things are at Caspian's castle," said Edmund.</p><p>"No, they're not," said Peter, still leading the way into the thickest
wood.  "They're all here.  They were brought down in bundles this
morning.  It's all arranged."</p><p>"Was that what Aslan was talking to you and Susan about this morning?"
asked Lucy.</p><p>"Yes—that and other things," said Peter, his face very solemn.  "I
can't tell it to you all.  There were things he wanted to say to Su and
me because we're not coming back to Narnia."</p><p>"Never?" cried Edmund and Lucy in dismay.</p><p>"Oh, you two are," answered Peter.  "At least, from what he said, I'm
pretty sure he means you to get back some day.  But not Su and me.  He
says we're getting too old."</p><p>"Oh, Peter," said Lucy.  "What awful bad luck.  Can you bear it?"</p><p>"Well, I think I can," said Peter.  "It's all rather different from
what I thought.  You'll understand when it comes to your last time.
But, quick, here are our things."</p><p>It was odd, and not very nice, to take off their royal clothes and to
come back in their school things (not very fresh now) into that great
assembly.  One or two of the nastier Telmarines jeered.  But the other
creatures all cheered and rose up in honour of Peter the High King, and
Queen Susan of the Horn, and King Edmund and Queen Lucy.  There were
affectionate and (on Lucy's part) tearful farewells with all their old
friends—animal kisses, and hugs from Bulgy Bears, and hands wrung by
Trumpkin, and a last tickly, whiskerish embrace with Trufflehunter.
And of course Caspian offered the Horn back to Susan and of course
Susan told him to keep it.  And then, wonderfully and terribly, it was
farewell to Aslan himself, and Peter took his place with Susan's hands
on his shoulders and Edmund's on hers and Lucy's on his and the first
of the Telmarine's on Lucy's, and so in a long line they moved forward
to the Door.  After that came a moment which is hard to describe, for
the children seemed to be seeing three things at once.  One was the
mouth of a cave opening into the glaring green and blue of an island in
the Pacific, where all the Telmarines would find themselves the moment
they were through the Door.  The second was a glade in Narnia, the
faces of Dwarfs and Beasts, the deep eyes of Aslan, and the white
patches on the Badger's cheeks.  But the third (which rapidly swallowed
up the other two) was the grey, gravelly surface of a platform in a
country station, and a seat with luggage round it, where they were all
sitting as if they had never moved from it—a little flat and dreary
for a moment after all they had been through, but also, unexpectedly,
nice in its own way, what with the familiar railway smell and the
English sky and the summer term before them.</p><p>"Well!" said Peter.  "We <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> had a time."</p><p>"Bother!" said Edmund.  "I've left my new torch in Narnia."</p></section><footer/></body></html>
